Purpose of this Java Brick breaker game:
    With this game I lay out multiple intentions in the area of learning purposes
    such as improving in OOP paradigm, implementing (very basic) multi-threading, making game in Game-loop design pattern, rendering game levels from the text file data.
For the sake of simulating the game development as in real life I will also create an UML diagram before making the game itself.
